# Jekyll-IndieWeb

Welcome to Jekyll-Indieweb. The goal of this project was to provide someone without a web presence a quick and easy way to start using the basics of the [Indieweb](https://indiewebcamp.com). It has now evolved into a formal Jekyll theme, with a companion repository for demonstrating how to use the theme (and eventually, include GitHub Actions and/or Netlify for deploy.)

Visit [Steal This Repo](https://github.com/miklb/steal-this-repo) if you would like a starter repository you can fork and customize while benefiting from improvements in this theme.

## Motivation

I've followed along a few [IndieWeb Camps](https://indiewebcamp.com/IWC) and observed a few people new to both the indieweb as well as having their own web presence. I wanted to provide another option for those users to have a fairly simple method to easily get up and going with with a web site ready for indieweb and be able to dive in.

## Installation

If you have never set up Jekyll or Ruby in your local environment, we recommend the Jekyll docs for [installing on your platform.](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)

We use the [latest stable Ruby version for development](https://github.com/miklb/jekyll-indieweb/blob/master/.ruby-version)

We also use [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) for our build tool. Though Jekyll has support for Sass, we have opted to write plain CSS for 2019 browsers and let the tools backfill for compatibility. If you haven't worked with Gulp before, we recommend their [getting started docs](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start) which includes a link to [Node install steps](https://nodejs.org/en/)


Clone the repository

```{bash}
git clone https://github.com/miklb/jekyll-indieweb.git
```

navigate to the directory

```bash
cd jekyll-indieweb
```

install the Jekyll dependencies

```bash
bundle install
```

install the Gulp dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

`Gulpfile` has two main tasks: `build` and `watch`

`build` does just that - builds the `_site` directory.

`watch` watches both `assets/css/_inc` directory to check for CSS changes as well as Jekyll file changes and rebuilds the appopriate files.

**A note about the CSS** All CSS is in the `_inc` directory is plain CSS. Current browser support for variables is strong, but we use PostCSS to fill in browser compatibility. PostCSS also compiles `assets/css/_inc/main.css` into `assets/css/main.css`. You should never need to edit `assets/css/main.css` file directly.

**Note** The Jekyll Gulp task replaces the need to use `bundle exec jekyll serve`. Instead, use `gulp watch`.

Reminder that this is a [Jekyll theme](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/), not a stand alone site.

We optimized the build tools in this project with three goals:

* quick deploy.
* provide an out-of-the-box experience when using the theme as is.
* allow overriding `main.css` in the individual response site for event specific customizations.

When submitting a new Pull Request with CSS changes, make sure to edit a file in `_inc` and commit **all** file changes with your PR.
